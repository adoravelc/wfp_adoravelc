    <h3>by adoravelc</h3>
    <p>Hello and welcome! I'm glad you're here. This blog is where I share my journey with technology, coding, and everything I've learned along the way.</p>

    <h2>Why I Started Learning Laravel</h2>
    <p>My journey into web development began with simple static pages, but soon I realized that I wanted to create more dynamic and complex applications. That's when I discovered Laravel, a PHP framework that simplifies many aspects of web development. Laravel's elegant syntax and powerful features quickly caught my attention, and now I'm diving deep into learning it!</p>
